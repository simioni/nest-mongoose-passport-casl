### Tested, documented, and production-ready.
</br>

**Nest Pret** is a replicable NestJS project that solves much of the functionality required from a modern web app.

- User registration
- Password recovery<!-- - User consent for TOS, Cookies, Policies, etc -->
- E-mail verification, configurable between:
  - ***required*** before login
  - ***delayed*** until a route with `EmailVerifiedGuard` enforces it
  - or ***off***
- Claims-based access control, including:
  - Restricted access to routes via policies
  - Restricted access to specific documents by ownership or other conditional constraints
  - Serialization of response objects exposing only the fields the user has access to
- Standardized API responses, including:
  - Automatic wrapping of return objects into a StandardResponse
  - Metadata-based ‚Äî handlers remains returning Classes compatible with interceptors
  - Handling of pagination, sorting and filtering
  - Generation of OpenAPI documentation for routes with the proper combined response schema
  <!-- - Generation of OpenAPI response examples with proper serialization for each user role -->

  - Complete end-to-end testing suites
  - 100% coverage of all user interaction flows

<br />

# Getting started

* Clone this repo
* Edit the ```.env``` file and add at least your mailer service information.

<br />

## üê≥ &nbsp; Start using Docker
To start using Docker, run:

    npm run dev

This will start a docker compose with:
- the dev database<!-- - a redis instance; -->
- a mongo-express visual DB admin page at `localhost:8081`
- the NestJS app in watch mode at `localhost:3000`

Only for the `development` env, the app will also serve documentation and a dependency graph:

- Swagger UI documentation explorer: `localhost:3000/dev-tools/docs`
- Swagger documentation JSON: `localhost:3000/dev-tools/docs-json`
- MermaidJS graph providing a high level view of the inter-module dependencies: `localhost:3000/dev-tools/graph`

> If running in Docker, you're not required to run ```npm install``` locally, but you still might want to do so in order to get features such as auto-import and auto-complete in your code editor.

<br />
<br />

## üêß &nbsp; Start without docker

Make sure to edit ```.env``` file to add the connection information for your mongo database, then run:

    npm install
    npm run start:dev

<br />
<br />

## üßê &nbsp; Running tests

To run unit and integration tests (locally):

```
npm run test
```
or 
```
npm run test:watch
```

To run e2e tests:

```
npm run e2e
```

> This command will lift a full docker compose configuration with the testing environment, run all the tests against it, print the output, then immediately exit and prune all docker resources created.

You can also run e2e tests in watch mode:

```
npm run e2e:watch
```

Note that running in this mode will keep the entire docker testing environment up. Once you're done with testing, you can take it down and clear everything by running:

```
npm run e2e:down
```

<!-- <br />
<br />

## üöÄ &nbsp; Running in production

Make sure to edit the `.env` file to add the correct production information for your domain, mailer service, and a private container registry where the application container will be published to.

### On your local machine:

Test, build and publish the container

```
npm run e2e
npm run build
npm run publish
```

### Prepare the servers:
1. Start one or more servers or VPSs on your cloud provider of choice and install Docker on them;
2. Start docker in swarm mode; If running multiple servers, add them to the swarm;
3. SSH into the swarms *manager node* and copy the following files onto it: `.env`, `docker-swarm.yml`, `package.json`;
4. Still on the manager node, run:

```
npm run prod
```

This will start the following containers onto the swarm:

- nginx as a reverse proxy
- the production database
- redis
- the NestJS app

When running in `production` env, the app will not provide the same tools it does in development (documentation and dependency graph). It does, however, provide some other tools:

- mgob for periodic database backups
- metrics & monitoring

## Rolling updates

Once you've changed your code and are ready to update the production version, make sure to test, build and publish your updated container:

```
npm run e2e
npm run build
npm run publish
```

Then SSH into your server and run:

```
npm run update
```

The swarm will start new updated containers to replace the current ones with zero downtime. If the update fails for some reason, you can rollback the update by running:

```
npm run rollback
``` -->

<!-- # Motivation

NestJS achieves a great balance between performance, development speed and developer experience. By using TS/JS, it can tap on a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools

This project:
- enforces automatic linting and code formatting;
- is fully tested and encourages test-driven development;
- provides a "single source of truth" architecture for data Models that grant security in operations while avoiding code duplication;

<br />

## Model Classes as a "single source of truth" for data entities

In Typescript, data Models and their property types are usually defined as an `Interface` that is implemented by a schema or entity class 

- A schema, used by mongoose to provide type safety (and code completion, easier refactoring, etc...)
  - The schema contains all properties from the model, and represents the data exactly as it is saved in the DB
- Data validation on input
  - Contain only the fields that are acceptable for a given operation -->

# Models

Model Classes serve as a 'single source of truth' for all modeled data. They are used as an `Interface` to create the mongoose [schemas](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/typescript/schemas.html), but they are also used to create DTOs using [Mapped Types](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/mapped-types).

The information on Model properties also defines input validation rules enforced when the model is expected in requests, and defines serialization rules when the model is send in responses.

Finally, model properties can also provide OpenAPI documentation information, like descriptions and usage examples.

Having all this information present in a central Model Class avoids code duplication, since derivative classes only need to pick what properties of the Model they want, without worrying about providing documentation, examples, validation rules, etc.

This means that properties on a Model Class can have up to ***4 types*** of decorators on them:

1. ***Schema*** - `@Prop()` from '@nestjs/mongoose' to add the property to the schema;
2. ***Docs*** - `@ApiProperty()` from '@nestjs/swagger' to add documentation and examples;
3. ***Serialization*** - `@Exclude()`, `@Expose()`, and `@Transform()` from 'class-transformer' to define serialization rules;
4. ***Validation*** - `@IsString()`, `@IsEmail()`, `@Min()`, etc... from 'class-validator' to perform input validation;


<details>
<summary>
<h3>üìö Example:</h3>
</summary>

```ts
@Schema() // ‚¨Ö marks a class to be used as the Interface for the mongoose schema
class User {
  @Prop() // ‚¨Ö marks this property to appear in the mongoose schema
  @ApiProperty({ example: 'Mark' }) // ‚¨Ö provides OpenAPI documentation for this property
  name: string;

  @Prop({ index: { unique: true } }) // ‚¨Ö accepts the same options as a 'new Mongoose.Schema()'
  @ApiProperty({ example: 'markhiggens3310@gmail.com' })
  @IsEmail() // ‚¨Ö provides validation when this property is required as an input
  email: string;

  // ‚¨á will exclude this property on 'output', i.e. from the serialized object sent in responses (but allow it on input)
  @Exclude({ toPlainOnly: true })
  @Prop()
  password: string;
  
  // ‚¨á will exclude this property on 'input', i.e. from request DTOs and validation (but allow it in responses)
  @Exclude({ toClassOnly: true })
  @Prop()
  lastSeenAt: Date;

  @Exclude() // ‚¨Ö will exclude this property in both directions
  @Prop()
  chatAccessKey: string;

  // ‚¨á only admins will see this property in the serialized response, it's excluded for everyone else
  @Expose({ groups: ['Admin'] })
  @Prop({ type: Date, default: Date.now })
  @IsDateString()
  registeredAt: Date;

  // ‚¨á allows you to easily create instances of this model from a document from the DB
  constructor(partial: Partial<User> = {}) {
    Object.assign(this, partial);
  }

  // ‚¨á you can add other props and utility methods on the model class
  hasCake() {
    const registeredDaysAgo = (new Date().getTime() - this.registeredAt.getTime()) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24;
    return registeredDaysAgo > 365; // üç∞ account is at least one year old!
  }
}
```

</details>

<br />

## Sending data

When sending data in responses, it's important to always send instances of a Model Class, or instances of DTOs created from it. You can either send a single one, or an array of them. But never send documents retrieved from the database directly in reponses! The serialization rules (and all other benefits from the model) only apply to instances of the Model or derived classes, not documents from the DB.

This also means you **should not** wrap the returned model in any other javascript object. If you need to add more data to the response (like pagination, filtering, additional messages, etc), you should add them using the metadata decorators provided by `nest-standard-response`.

<details>
<summary>
<h3>üìö Example:</h3>
</summary>

```ts
@Controller('user')
export class UserController {
  @Get()
  @StandardResponse({ // ‚¨Ö setup a StandardResponse wrapper
    isPaginated: true,
  })
  public async findAll(
    // ‚¨á injects a StandardParam providing methods to manipulate the wrapper
    @StandardParam() params: StandardParams
  ): Promise<User[]> { // ‚¨Ö route return type must always resolve to Model or Model[]
    const users: UserDocument[] = await this.userModel
      .find()
      .limit(params.paginationInfo.limit) // ‚¨Ö we get pagination query params for free
      .skip(params.paginationInfo.offset) //    by using the isPaginated option above
      .exec();

    params.setMessage('Custom message...') // ‚¨Ö adds a custom message to the response
    params.setExtra('myCustomProperty', { // ‚¨Ö add some extra field in the response
      customObjProp1: 'any serializable value',
      customObjProp2: { nested: true },
    });
    // ‚¨á Use the document from the DB to construct a new Model() before returning
    return users.map((userDoc) => new User(userDoc.toJSON()));
  }
}
```

### The response from this route would look like this:

Note the smart serialization in the response! The field `registeredAt` is only present when an `admin` is making the request. It would be hidden from other users because of the serialization rules in the model.

```ts
{
  success: true,
  message: "Custom message...",
  isArray: true,
  isPaginated: true,
  pagination: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0,
    defaultLimit: 10,
  },
  myCustomProperty: {
    customObjProp1: 'any serializable value',
    customObjProp2: { nested: true },
  }
  data: [{
    name: "Mark",
    email: 'mark8829@gmail.com',
    registeredAt: '2023-11-09T13:06:37.384Z'
  }, {
    name: "Jane",
    email: 'itsmejane@gmail.com',
    registeredAt: '2023-11-09T13:06:37.384Z'
  }, {
    name: "Eva",
    email: 'evanance@hotmail.com' },
    registeredAt: '2023-11-09T13:06:37.384Z'
  }]
}
```

</details>

<br />

## Receving data

The same is true for receving data in the request params or body. Always strongly type the expected data as the Model Class or a DTO derived from it. This way the data gets auto validation from the global `ValidationPipe`, plus the route gets auto documentation in Open API.

<details>
<summary>
<h3>üìö Example:</h3>
</summary>

```ts
// CreateUserDto.ts

// ‚¨á We choose the properties we want from the model with MappedTypes, so this DTO will inherit all
// the validation and serialization logic we defined there, without having to duplicate anything

const requiredFields = ['email', 'password'] as const;
const optionalFields = ['name', 'familyName', 'phone', 'birthDate'] as const;

export class CreateUserDto extends IntersectionType(
  PartialType(PickType(User, optionalFields)),
  PickType(User, requiredFields),
) {}

```

```ts
@Controller('user')
export class UserController {
  @Post())
  public async create(
    // ‚¨á Setting our DTO as the Type for the request body means it will be automatically validated
    // by the global ValidationPipe.
    @Body() createUserDto: CreateUserDto
  ): Promise<User> {
    // Any request to this route with a body that's missing required fields, or that contains fields
    // with values that fail the model validation rules will result in a HTTP 400 Bad Request exception,
    // and this handler will never be executed.
    // This means it's safe to use body here without any further validation
    return await this.userService.create(createUserDto);
  }
}
}
```
</details>


---------------------------------------------------


<br />
<br />

## üîÆ Use concrete JS classes as types, not Typescript interfaces

Typescript interfaces are completely removed from compiled code. Since we want to perform data validation and transformation at runtime, all models and DTOs must use Classes instead. TS Classes can also be used as ***types*** when needed, but they are persisted as JS Classes in the compiled code.

Most decorators work by using the JS [Reflect API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect) to store metadata inside of those classes. This often includes the ***type*** that those values had in Typescript, but can also include any other value the decorator thinks the app might need at runtime.

At any point during the app execution, other parts of the app might use [Reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming) to inspect this metadata before deciding on an action. That's how the `ValidationPipe` can inspect a Model or DTO instance and validate the ***type*** of its properties, or how the `RoleSerializerInterceptor` can retrieve the rules used serialize a value.

# Auth Module <a name="AuthModule"></a> üö™
<p align="right"><a href="#RefIndex"><small>Back to index &nbsp;‚§¥</small></a></p>

- Allows account creation;
- Sends e-mail verification and keeps track of confirmation status;
- Sends forgotten password emails and allows password reset;
- Manages log-in and JWTs;
- Guard routes from unlogged users and injects the logged-in user into the request.

</br>
</br>

# Policies Module <a name="PoliciesModule"></a> üèõÔ∏è
<p align="right"><a href="#RefIndex"><small>Back to index &nbsp;‚§¥</small></a></p>

- Defines policies limiting any individual user to access only resources they can claim;
- Claims define which `Actions` (create, read, update, etc...) any user `Role` can take on each `Model`;
- Claims can also define *constraint queries*, for example allowing a user to read the `User` model, but only for his own user; or to update `Articles`, but only those authored by himself;

> Note: There is no `Articles` module provided by this app. This is just an example on how you can define policies for any model you want.

Policies are defined using [Casl](https://github.com/stalniy/casl).

<br />

## CaslAbilityFactory <a name="CaslAbilityFactory"></a>

The `CaslAbilityFactory` provider exposes the `createForUser` function, which is called during a request with the logged-in user information, and should return a casl `Ability` object constructed using the provided `can` or `cannot` methods. This function is free to inspect the user object and define any custom logic it needs to limit individual access to `actions` taken on `models`.

Example:

```ts
if (user.roles.includes(UserRole.USER)) {
  // users can view and update their own info,
  // view any article, and update articles authored by them
  can([Action.Read, Action.Update], User, { _id: user._id });
  can(Action.Read, Article);
  can(Action.Update, Article, { authorId: user._id });
}
if (user.roles.includes(UserRole.MOD)) {
  // mods can read and update any user or any article
  can([Action.Read, Action.Update], User);
  can([Action.Read, Action.Update], Article);
}
if (user.roles.includes(UserRole.ADMIN)) {
  // admins can do anything. Note that 'manage' in casl means all actions,
  // and the keywork 'all' means in all models. Common actions are 'create',
  // 'read', 'update', 'delete' and 'list', but you can extend the Actions enum
  // with any other action you want
  can(Action.Manage, 'all');
}
```

<br />

## Protecting routes <a name="PoliciesGuard"></a><a name="CheckPoliciesDecorator"></a>

Just add the `PoliciesGuard` to any controller or route. Since policies depend on the user object, using this guard also requires using `AuthGuard` or other mechanism that guarantees log-in.

```ts
@UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt'), PoliciesGuard)
```

Once this guard is in place, you can add the `@CheckPolicies()` decorator to any route, and choose the claims that are required to access this route. `@CheckPolicies()` expects a simple function that is called with the `userAbility` object, so you can use `can` or `cannot` methods on it to define which Actions this route requires on which Models.

```ts
@CheckPolicies((ability: UserAbility) => ability.can(Action.List, User))
```

Checking policies in this way is very efficient, since requests can be denied at the Guard level, without even executing the route handler. But it is also limited: it cannot check for *constraint queries* since no document has been retrieved from the DB yet. If the logged-in user has access to ***at least one document*** for a given Model, it will be granted access by the guard, and you should check for constraints during the route handling.

<br />

## Protecting access per-document <a name="UserAbilityParamDecorator"></a>

- The `userAbility` object is also injected in the request object, and you can retrieve it by using `req.userAbility`;
- If this is all you're using from the request object, it can be cleaner to inject it directly using the custom param decorator `@UserAbilityParam()`;

This allows you to retrieve documents from the database and call the `can` or `cannot` methods against them. Note that here these methods are called using an instance of the model (instead of on the Model class itself).

```ts
function findOne(
  @UserAbilityParam() userAbility: UserAbility,
) {
  const user = await this.userService.findOne(idOrEmail);
  if (userAbility.cannot(Action.Read, user)) {
    throw new ForbiddenException();
  }
  return user;
}
```
</br>

# User Module <a name="UserModule"></a> üë§
<p align="right"><a href="#RefIndex"><small>Back to index &nbsp;‚§¥</small></a></p>

- Defines the User model, schema and DTOs;
- Defines the services required to create, read, update, delete, list, reset password, and verify email;
- Most services from this module are consumed by the Auth module for managing accounts;
- The user controller provides routes that can be used by admins to manage users from a backend outside of the auth flow;
- Some routes can also be used by users to view or update their own profile;

<br />

## EmailVerifiedGuard <a name="EmailVerifiedGuard"></a>

If the app is configured to use ***delayed*** email verification, users will be logged in automatically after account creation, and will be allowed to login anytime without clicking the verification link.

To protect access to certain routes only to users who have verified their email, you can add the ```EmailVerifiedGuard``` to any controller or route.


```ts
@UseGuards(EmailVerifiedGuard)
```

>- If the app is configured to use ***required*** email verification, users will be asked to verified their email before being allowed to log-in. In that case, this guard is redundant.
>
>- If the app is configured with email verification ***off***, this guard shoud not be used, since it will never allow access to the routes under it.
>
>- The routes from the `UserController` that allow users to view and edit their own information use this guard. If you're setting this setting to ***off***, you should also remove this guard from that controller.

<br />

## EmailOrIdPipe <a name="EmailOrIdPipe"></a>

Both `email` and `id` are unique keys in the user schema. An `id` provides consistency since it should never be changed, and also provides some privacy if you need to include a user reference in a public link without exposing their `email`. However, sometimes using an email can be more convenient.

That's why routes and services from the `User` module accept **both** an `id` or an `email` as the target for their operations. To validate the input parameters in those cases, the app provides the `EmailOrIdPipe` pipe.

```ts
@Controller('user')
export class UserController {
  constructor(private readonly userService: UserService) {}

  @Get(':idOrEmail')
  public async findOne(
    @Param('idOrEmail', EmailOrIdPipe) idOrEmail: string

    const user = await this.userService.findOne(idOrEmail);
    ...

}
```

When used, it makes sure the piped data is either a syntactically valid `email` or a syntactically valid `ObjectId`. Note that a pipe can only check for syntax. It will throw a HTTP 400 BadRequestException if the provided information is malformatted, but it's possible that the information is valid yet still doesn't match any known user from the DB.

# Mailer Module <a name="MailerModule"></a> üìÆ
<p align="right"><a href="#RefIndex"><small>Back to index &nbsp;‚§¥</small></a></p>

- Automatically creates and configures a nodemailer instance using info from the .env file injected by the config module;
- Defines services for sending emails;
- Currently this module can send the following emails:
  - Welcome
  - Please confirm yout email
  - Forgot your password?
  - Your password was reset

</br>

# Config Module <a name="ConfigModule"></a> ‚öôÔ∏è
<p align="right"><a href="#RefIndex"><small>Back to index &nbsp;‚§¥</small></a></p>

- Prevents runtime errors by validating environment variables during app startup;
- Provides helpful console messages when envorinment variables are missing or invalid;
- Parses `.env` vars into a strongly typed Configuration object that can be dependency injected;
- Exposes interfaces that can be used to provide types when calling the `configService.get<>()` generic method;

Example:
```ts
@Controller('books')
export class BooksController {
  constructor(private readonly configService: ConfigService) {}

  @Get()
  public async listBooks() {
    const apiConfig = this.configService.get<ApiConfig>('api'); 
    // equivalent to process.env.API_INTERNAL_URL,
    // but parsed, typed, and guarateed to exist
    console.log(apiConfig.internalUrl);
  }
}
```

* Metadata-based wrapper to provide customizable and standardized API response objects;

* Built-in handling of pagination, sorting and filtering;

* Allows route handlers to keep returning classes instead of wrapper objects, so they remain fully compatible with interceptors;

# Test Module <a name="TestModule"></a> üß™
<p align="right"><a href="#RefIndex"><small>Back to index &nbsp;‚§¥</small></a></p>

- Provides end-to-end testing of all user interaction flows;
- e2e tests run in docker, always on a freshly created environment;
- Jest runs tests in parallel, so each test file needs to instantiate the app in it's own thread;
- The DB is shared between all threads. To avoid racing conditions, the DB should never be dropped during testing. Use the provided factories to create and destroy resources instead.

To facilitate creating and destroing instances of the NestJS application, as well as creating and destroing all kinds of different users, this project provides two utility factories:

<br />

## *TestingServerFactory* & *UserStubFactory* <a name="TestingServerFactory"></a><a name="UserStubFactory"></a>

<br />

When adding new modules to the app, create a related `yourmodule.e2e-spec.ts` test file in the `/tests` folder, and inside the `beforeAll` hook from jest, instantiate a new app by calling `await new TestingServerFactory().create()`.

This method will create a new nest TestingModule, mock the mailer service, start the app, auto-increment the port number to avoid conflicts, and return a class instance with methods to retrieve all the created resources, like the `getModule()`, `getApp()` and `getBaseUrl()`.

Since this gives you access to the underlying NestJS TestingModule, you can get reach any part of the nest app by using the `get()` and `resolve()` methods on the module.

To create stub users for testing access control and serialization features, use the ***UserStubFactory***. It provides methods for creating regular users, users with verified emails, admin users, etc. And also methods to login those users and get their access tokens, as well as deleting them when no longer needed.

Remember to delete any created stub user in the `afterAll` hook, as well as calling `app.close()`.

Example:

```ts
describe('BooksController (e2e)', () => {
  let app: INestApplication;
  let stub: UserStubFactory;
  let verifiedUser: FakeUser;
  let verifiedUserToken: string;
  beforeAll(async () => {
    const testingServer = await new TestingServerFactory().create();
    const testingModule = testingServer.getModule();
    app = testingServer.getApp();
    booksService = await testingModule.resolve(BooksService);

    stub = new UserStubFactory(testingServer);
    verifiedUser = await stub.registerNewVerifiedUser({ firstName: 'Martha' });
    verifiedUserToken = await stub.getLoginTokenForUser(verifiedUser);
  });
  afterAll(async () => {
    await stub.deleteUser(verifiedUser.email);
    await app.close();
  });
}
```

## üöÄ &nbsp; TODO Milestones

<!-- - Add a Redis instance in docker-compose, and:
  - expose it's config via .env and the config module;
  - Cache the user from login tokens so we don't need to hit the DB in every request to retrieve it;
  - Cache the abilities created by casl for a given user so it don't need to be recreated inside the policies every on every request;
  - share @nestjs/throttler storage in Redis
-->
- Add a [mgob](https://github.com/maxisam/mgob) instance to the production docker swarm for automated mongo backups (and add its configurations via .env)
- Add some tool to the production docker swarm to expose server metrics
- Add user consent forms with versioned policies
- Add option for log-in using social media accounts

<br />

# Origins

A lot of the code in this repo came from my own projects, and it's a culmination of features that I had to implement frequently for different systems.

Modern web apps tend to have similar initial demands, so the fastest way to go about starting a new project was copying code around and modifying it a bit. An easy but repetitive task that removes all the joy out of building software.

This generator provides a way to bootstrap a modern Typescript web app in a way that is not only ***fast***, but more importantly, ***fun***. It covers the basics to let me focus on building the good stuff, the actual features unique to each system.

I hope you can find some fun in it as well. üòä
